    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with large data files or collections, it's often impossible to load all the data you want to analyze into a single computer's RAM at once. This is a situation where the Pangeo ecosystem can help you a lot. Xarray offers the possibility to work lazily on data __chunks__, which means pieces of an entire dataset. By reading a dataset in __chunks__ we can process our data piece by piece on a single computer and even on a distributed computing cluster using Dask (Kubernetes or HPC for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "How we will process these 'chunks' in a parallel environment will be discussed in [dask_introduction](./dask_introduction.ipynb). The concept of __chunk__ will be explained here.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we process our data piece by piece, it's easier to have our input or ouput data also saved in __chunks__. [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the reference library in the Pangeo ecosystem to save our Xarray multidimentional datasets in __chunks__.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is not the only file format which uses __chunk__. We will also be using [kerchunk library](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/) in this notebook to build a virtual __chunked__ dataset based on NetCDF files, and show how it optimizes the access and analysis of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is very similar to what we have done in previous episodes, however we will use data on a global coverage and not only on a small geographical area (e.g. Lombardia).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this episode, we will be using Global Long Term Statistics (1999-2019) products provided by the [Copernicus Global Land Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/index.html) and access them through [S3-comptabile storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) ([OpenStack Object Storage \"Swift\"](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift)) with a data catalog we have created and made publicly available."

This is true when applying any funtions on any values: Xarray will work by loading entire chunks.\n",
    "\n",

    "## So, why chunks?\n",

    "### Chunks and files\n",
    "\n",
    "Xarray chunking possibilities also relies on the underlying input or output file format used. Most modern file format allows to store a dataset or a single file using chunks. NetCDF4 uses chunks when storing a file on the disk through the use of HDF5. Any read of data in a NetCDF4 file will lead to the load of at least one chunk of this file. So when reading one of its chunk as defined in `open_dataset` call, Xarray will take advantage of native file chunking and won't have to read the entire file too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, it is really important to note that __Xarray chunks and file chunks are not necessarily the same__. It is however a really good idea to configure Xarray chunks so that they align well on input file format chunks (so ideally, Xarray chunks should contain one or several input file chunks)."

    "As shown in the [Data discovery](./data_discovery.ipynb) chapter, when we have several files to read at once, we need to use Xarray `open_mfdataset`. When using `open_mfdataset` with NetCDF files, each NetCDF file is considerd as 'one chunk' by default as seen above, so a good practice would be to use `chunks` too, but which chunk size? \n",
    "\n",
    "When calling `open_mfdataset`, Xarray also needs to analyse each NetCDF file to get metadatas and tried to build a coherent dataset from them. Thus, it performs multiple operations, like concartenate the coordinate, checking compatibility, etc., which can be time consuming (especially when dealing with object storage), and has to be repeated every time, even if we use exactly the same set of input files for different analysis.\n",

Chunks are defined at the creation of each file.  Let's call them 'native __chunks__' as opposed to Xarray __chunks__.  These native chunks can be retrieved and used when opening and accessing the files. This will allow to significantly reduce the amount of IOs, bandwith, and memory usage when analyzing Data Variables (only the needed chunks will be transferred, once).\n",

    "Understanding chunking is key to optimize your data analysis when dealing with big datasets. In this episode we learned how to optimize the data access time and memory resources by exploiting native chunks from netCDF4 data files and instructing Xarray to access data per chunk. However, computations on big datasets can be very slow on a single computer, and to optimize its time we may need to parallelize our data analysis. This is what you will learn in the next episode with Dask."
