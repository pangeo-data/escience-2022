# Project Pythia

:::{tip}
Project Pythia, https://projectpythia.org/, is the education working group for Pangeo and is an educational resource for the entire geoscience community. 
The information below highlights some notions of the initiative. We also include a recent presentation authored by Clyne et al. (2022). 

For further details, we suggest visiting Pythia's [About section](https://projectpythia.org/about.html#presentations-about-project-pythia).

## About
Project Pythia is a home for Python-centered learning resources that are open-source, community-owned, geoscience-focused, and high-quality.

## Who is Project Pythia?
The current core Pythia team can be found [here](https://projectpythia.org/index.html#the-project-pythia-team). Pythia is an open and inclusive community! Look [here](https://projectpythia.org/index.html#join-us) for info on how to get involved.

## Project Pythia Goals
1. _The Pythia Portal:_ A searchable online portal that
   provides scientists at any point in their career with educational
   content and real-world examples needed to learn how to navigate and
   integrate the myriad packages within the Python ecosystem for the
   geosciences.

2. _Cloud-Deployable Pythia Platforms:_ A light-weight,
   Binder-based platform that will make it possible to launch portal
   content in customizable executable environments in the Cloud with
   only a “single click.”
