# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

:::{tip}
This work used advanced computing resources from the [CESNET](https://www.cesnet.cz/?lang=en) resource centre of the [EGI federation](https://www.egi.eu/egi-federation/). The services are co-funded by the [EGI-ACE project](https://www.egi.eu/project/egi-ace/), grant number 101017567. 

We also would like to thank the Pangeo Europe Team and in particular Guillaume Eynard-Bontemps and Jean Iaquinta for the Pangeo deployment, and Anne Fouilloux and Tina Odaka for the training material content and delivery.**

## The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)

![EOSC logo](./figures/EOSC_logo-small.png)

The [European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)](https://eosc-portal.eu/about/eosc) aims at becoming the main environment for hosting and processing research data to support European Science. 

The ambition of EOSC is to have a **federated** and **open multi-disciplinary** environment where you can publish, find and re-use data, tools and services for research, innovation and educational purposes. 
There is not one unique cloud provider offering all the EOSC compute and storage resources: an [onboarding process](https://eosc-portal.eu/providers-documentation/eosc-provider-portal-basic-guide) has been defined to allow new resource providers to register their services to EOSC.

EOSC is still under development and it is often difficult to understand what is made available to you or what will be made available. 
On the other hand, as a researcher, innovator, company or citizen you can contribute to build it, for instance by providing feedback on the available tools and services. 

EOSC is run as a [co-programmed European Partnership under Horizon Europe from 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe/european-partnerships-horizon-europe/candidates-across-themes_en). [Horizon Europe](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe_en) is the European Commission's research and innovation funding programme (started in 2021 and succeeding the Horizon 2020 European programme).

## Pangeo Europe and EGI-ACE

![Pangeo logo](./figures/pangeo_name_logo.png) 

[Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) is a worldwide community for Big Data geoscience promoting open, reproducible, and scalable science. 

A short introduction to Pangeo can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XB9jmKlPnyAtUWRG_xzGC9h3qn_88gVSegOI3uDcaKo/edit?usp=sharing).

[Pangeo Europe](https://pangeo.io/meeting-notes.html) aims at highlighting European contributions to the Pangeo Community and at providing a reference deployment for Pangeo on EOSC. 
The Pangeo deployment on EOSC has been made possible thanks to the [EGI-ACE](https://www.egi.eu/project/egi-ace/) project through their [Open Call](https://www.egi.eu/egi-ace-open-call/).

![EGI-ACE](./figures/EGI-ACE_logo.png)

[EGI-ACE](https://www.egi.eu/project/egi-ace/) (EU H2020 project, January 2021 - June 2023) offers compute and storage resources, compute platform services, data management services and related user support and training through open calls. 
The majority of the services are sponsored (pre-paid) for the users by the European Commission and by national funding agencies. Some of the services are offered by commercial entities on a pay-per-use basis. 

**For the deployment of Pangeo on EOSC, [CESNET](https://www.cesnet.cz/?lang=en) is the provider that freely offered computing resources and storage.**
